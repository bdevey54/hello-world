# hello-world
Hello! My name is Brian. 

I have been coding HTML, CSS and JavaScript (to name a few) for enjoyment for 8+ years. Though I found enjoyment in coding and scripting I was never a focused, dedicated student. Wasted away the talent and ability I did have with development playing computer games. WoW. CS:GO. Yep. One of those stories. I'm sure you've heard this narrative before but please restrain your pity. My life still turned out pretty amazing. 

Married to a loving and beautiful wife, who is the mother of my cute as a button baby daughter. (Thus far) her favorite and most commonly shown expression is a smile. A smily girl, with tons of energy towards both the standard child pasttime of 'play with anything I think looks interesting' and socialization. Most social baby ever. My opinion is completely unbaised, Trust me. This amazing family, in the home my Wife and I bought. Lungs fully functional. Heart beating. Healthy. Alive. Life is good.

Now in my 30s I am reevaluating my life and re-aligning my values. Always wanted to be a web developer. Always enjoyed web development. Time to take that journey a bit more serious and focus on it a bit. Thus I am here, learning git and gitHub (among other things). Here to grind, learn and evolve my skills.
